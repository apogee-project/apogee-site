    "text": "Institutional support for research and education is essential for advancing knowledge and innovation. Securing external funding through grants is a critical aspect of this support, enabling researchers, educators, and institutions to pursue their scholarly and creative endeavors. However, the grant application and management process can be complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, posing challenges for researchers and administrators alike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: This diagram illustrates the key stages of a grant’s lifecycle, from project development to award closeout. AI and machine learning can enhance each phase by streamlining administrative tasks, improving funding identification, optimizing proposal writing, and supporting project management and reporting.\n\n\n\nSecuring and managing grants is a multi-stage process, depicted in Figure 1, that involves project development, funding identification, proposal submission, award administration, and reporting. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have potential applications throughout the grant lifecycle, potentially improving efficiency, reducing administrative burdens, and enhancing research and educational outcomes. Table 1 outlines a few (not exhaustive) specific ways AI/ML can support each phase of the grant lifecycle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant Lifecycle Stage\nAI/ML Role in Education, Research, and Administration\n\n\n\n\n1. Project Development\nAI-powered literature reviews and automated topic identification using NLP. Recommender systems for relevant research gaps.\n\n\n2. Identify Funding\nAI-based funding opportunity matching, automated alerts for relevant grants, and predictive analytics for funding success.\n\n\n3. Proposal Preparation\nAI-assisted writing tools for generating proposals, automated compliance checking, and past proposal analysis for insights.\n\n\n4. Proposal Submission\nAI-driven document validation, deadline tracking automation, and grant submission workflow optimization.\n\n\n5. Award Acceptance\nAI-supported contract analysis, budget validation, and automated notifications for compliance requirements.\n\n\n6. Project Start-up\nAI-powered onboarding tools for project teams, automated scheduling, and integration of administrative tasks.\n\n\n7. Award Management\nAI-based financial tracking, automated reporting tools, and predictive analytics for resource allocation.\n\n\n8. Award Closeout\nAI-driven final report generation, compliance audits, and impact assessment using NLP and machine learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: How can AI be used to support activities in each stage of the grant lifecycle?",

This phase will deliver a basic AI/ML-powered grant evaluation system that provides researchers with narrative and quantitative feedback on draft NIH grant proposals, supplementing traditional mock study sections and grant-writing workshops.\n1 The version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort (similar to a pilot experiment).This system will leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate writing style, alignment with the RFA, clarity of potential impact, and other key aspects of the proposal. The system will also provide suggestions for improvement and identify areas of strength and weakness.\nThe Phase 1 system will be designed to accept specific aims pages and the Significance and Impact sections of the grant as well as the RFA to which the grant is responding. It will generate narrative summaries, readability scores, similarity metrics to funded grants, keyword analyses, pointers to related research. The system will be accessible via a web interface and will be integrated with NIH Reporter and PubMed (which now includes preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv).\n\n\nPhases 2 and beyond\nBased on feedback from Phase 1, subsequent phases will expand the capabilities of the system to cover the entire grant lifecycle. This will include tools for pre-grant ideation, post-award management, and reporting. The system will be integrated with other research tools and databases to provide a comprehensive ecosystem for researchers, grant teams, and administrators.",
