## Data flow

The Apogee system consists of several key components that interact to provide a seamless user experience. @fig-data-flow illustrates the flow of data and processes within the system, highlighting the interactions between users, external services, and internal components.

### Key Components

1. Security Layer:
   - All processes are contained within a secure environment
   - Access requires VPN or campus connection
   - Authentication handled through SSO

2. Core Processes:
   - Authentication Process: Handles user verification
   - Document Processing: Manages document uploads
   - AI Analysis Process: Coordinates with Azure OpenAI
   - Notification Process: Manages email alerts
   - Result Viewing Process: Handles result display

3. External Systems:
   - SSO Service
   - Azure OpenAI
   - Email Service

4. Data Store:
   - Central database storing both documents and results

## Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between the user, the web application, external services, and the database. The flow of events starts with the user accessing the web application, logging in through the SSO service, uploading a document, triggering AI analysis, receiving a notification, and viewing the results.
